        <h3>The technologies</h3>

        &emsp;For a while I've been trying to introduce myself to webdev, the main issue has always been cost. Webdev isn't a
        particularly affordable endeavor, you have the costs of the domain, the host, and any other services you may want
        including but not limited to Wordpress, Canva, and or Squarespace. I was wrong. The website I'm going to walk you
        through building here costs less than $1.00/mo.<br><br>

        &emsp;We will start with our domains, there are a variety of domain managers, but I highly recommend porkbun.com. Porkbun
        is great because its affordable as of 2023, and doesn't get sold to squarespace cough cough google cough cough. It
        has a clean UI and is very easy to use, it looks like it makes security a primary concern and provides you with
        tools to help you build your website, regardless of if it is static or dynamic. Now that I've talked the service up
        let me give you the juice, my domain is only $10.00/yr. and that is going to be the entire cost of the website!<br><br>

        &emsp;The next question is going to be who will host the website, and for a personal blog I believe there is no
        better option than Github pages. Its free, it has automatic deployment and if you are used to using github then
        it is very easy to begin using!<br><br>

        <h3>The HTML</h3>

        &emsp;Depending on what IDE or text editor you use, you should have access to what is called snippets, in
        Webstorm you have bang tab. bang tab produces

        <pre><code>let x = 10;</code></pre>
    </div>
</main>
</body>
