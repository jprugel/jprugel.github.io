        <h3>The technologies</h3>

        &emsp;For a while I've been trying to introduce myself to webdev, the main issue has always been cost. Webdev isn't a
        particularly affordable endeavor, you have the costs of the domain, the host, and any other services you may
        want including but not limited to <a href="https://wordpress.com" class="link">Wordpress</a>,
        <a href="https://www.canva.com" class="link">Canva</a>, and or
        <a href="https://www.squarespace.com" class="link">Squarespace</a>. I was wrong. The website I'm going to walk
        you through building here costs less than $1.00/mo.<br><br>

        &emsp;We will start with our domains, there are a variety of domain managers, but I highly recommend
        <a href="https://porkbun.com" class="link">Porkbun</a>. Porkbun is great because its affordable as of 2023, and
        doesn't get sold to squarespace cough cough google cough cough. It has a clean UI and is very easy to use, it
        looks like it makes security a primary concern and provides you with tools to help you build your website,
        regardless of if it is static or dynamic. Now that I've talked the service up let me give you the juice, my
        domain is only $10.00/yr. and that is going to be the entire cost of the website!<br><br>

        &emsp;The next question is going to be who will host the website, and for a personal blog I believe there is no
        better option than <a href="https://pages.github.com" class="link">Github Pages</a>. Its free, it has automatic
        deployment and if you are used to using github then it is very easy to begin using!<br><br>

        <h3>Starting the project</h3>

        &emsp;If you've never created a static website before you have to start with an index.html file in your project.
        something along the line of:<br><br>

        <div class="file">
            <ul class="one">project</ul>
            <ul class="two">index.html</ul>
            <ul class="two last">styles.css</ul>
        </div><br>

        &emsp;Once you've created this project with the above file structure I'd recommend adding a template to your
        html file with either a snippet shortcut or using something like
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/chrisvfritz/bc010e6ed25b802da7eb" class="link">HTML Template</a>. With that you
        can push your initial commit to your Github and follow the guide on github pages to complete your website! Its
        really as simple as that!
